**Summary:** Attention and working memory are critical for successfully navigating our everyday lives. Surprisingly, however, we have no way to characterize — much less capture — a person’s attention and memory function as a whole. To address this challenge, I will demonstrate that a person’s unique pattern of functional brain connectivity can provide such a measure. In particular, I will show that models based on functional connectivity “fingerprints” predict how well people can pay attention and remember information in a variety of contexts. Throughout the talk I will highlight how testing brain-based predictive models across age and mental state can reveal specific and general neural signatures of behavior. For example, testing models across age can help identify developmental change points in the relationship between brain and behavior. Likewise, testing models across cognitive and emotional states (e.g., rest and task) can further constrain the specificity of predictive models. For instance, does perturbing neural circuits with cognitive tasks improve behavioral predictions? Moving forward, characterizing when models successfully predict behavior and when they fail can provide new insights into the functional architecture of attention and memory that is common or unique to development windows and mental states.

**Monica Rosenberg** will join the University of Chicago Department of Psychology as an Assistant Professor and director of the Cognition, Attention, and Brain (CAB) Lab in July. Her research explores how we pay attention, and how insights from attention research can help improve focus. Dr. Rosenberg completed her PhD and postdoctoral work in the Department of Psychology at Yale University after earning her undergraduate degree in cognitive neuroscience at Brown University.
